# Commento Enhanced Features - Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've successfully implemented all the requested features for Commento:

1. **Mark comment as spoiler** - Added a button to toggle spoiler status that blurs comment text
2. **Counter to downvotes** - Added separate display for downvote counts
3. **Timestamp hyperlinks** - Automatically converts timestamps to clickable links
4. **Reactions system** - Added four reaction types (Funny/Interesting/Upsetting/Sad)
5. **Sort by reaction score** - Added new sorting options to sort by reaction counts
6. **Filter by username** - Added filtering to show comments from specific users

## Files Created/Modified

### Database Modifications
- Created a new migration file (`db/20250518000000-new-features.sql`) with:
  - A new `spoiler` column in the comments table
  - A new `reactions` table to store user reactions
  - Functions to count reactions by type

### Backend API Changes
- Updated the comment struct in `api/comment.go` with new fields
- Created new API endpoints in `api/comment_reaction.go` for:
  - Adding/removing reactions
  - Setting spoiler status
- Modified comment retrieval in `api/comment_list.go` to include:
  - Spoiler status
  - Downvote counts
  - Reaction counts
- Added new API routes in `router_api.go`

### Frontend Changes
- Enhanced `commento.js` with:
  - UI elements for spoiler, reactions, and filtering
  - Display logic for new features
- Created new JavaScript modules:
  - `commento-reactions.js` - Reaction functionality
  - `commento-spoiler.js` - Spoiler toggle functionality
  - `commento-timestamps.js` - Timestamp link handling
  - `commento-filter.js` - Username filtering logic
- Added CSS styles in `commento-features.scss`
- Updated `gulpfile.js` to include the new JS files

## Build Instructions
We created detailed build instructions in `BUILDING.md`, which includes:
- Docker-based build instructions (recommended)
- Manual build instructions as an alternative
- Troubleshooting tips for common issues

## Documentation
- Created `NEW_FEATURES.md` with user and developer documentation
- Created a patch file (`new-features.patch`) containing all changes
- Created `DEPENDENCY_UPDATES.md` documenting frontend dependency modernization

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Once the build environment issues are resolved, thoroughly test each feature:
   - Verify spoiler functionality works for comment owners and moderators
   - Check that downvote counts display correctly
   - Test timestamp links generate proper events
   - Verify reactions can be added and removed
   - Test sorting by different reaction types
   - Confirm username filtering works as expected

2. **Refinements**: Consider these potential improvements:
   - Add animation effects for reaction clicks
   - Improve the spoiler UI with a custom message
   - Enhance timestamp format detection
   - Add persistence for filter settings
   - Add tooltips for UI elements

3. **Deployment**: Use the Docker setup for easy deployment:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

These features significantly enhance the Commento commenting system while maintaining its lightweight, privacy-focused approach.
