## Feature Summary

### Mark Comment as Spoiler
Allows comment authors and moderators to mark comments containing sensitive information as spoilers. These comments appear blurred until users hover over them, preventing accidental exposure to spoilers.

### Downvote Counter
Displays separate counts for downvotes, providing more transparent feedback on community sentiment regarding comments.

### Timestamp Hyperlinks
Automatically converts time references (e.g., "1:30") in comments to clickable links that trigger custom events. This enables integration with media players for timestamp navigation.

### Reaction System
Gives users additional ways to express their responses to comments beyond simple voting. The four reaction types (Funny, Interesting, Upsetting, and Sad) provide nuanced feedback.

### Sort by Reaction Score
Enhances comment sorting to allow users to view comments ranked by specific reaction types, helping them find the funniest, most interesting, most upsetting, or saddest comments.

### Filter by Username
Allows users to filter comments to show only those from specific commenters, making it easier to follow discussions between specific participants.

## Technical Implementation

The implementation follows modern JavaScript practices and integrates seamlessly with Commento's existing codebase. Key technical aspects include:

1. **Modular Design**: Each feature was implemented in separate JavaScript files for clean organization.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Features add minimal overhead to page load times.
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: New features don't interfere with core functionality.
4. **Responsive Design**: All features work well on both desktop and mobile views.

## Recommendations for Future Enhancements

1. **Analytics Dashboard**: Add reaction analytics to help site owners understand audience engagement.
2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Implement keyboard navigation for common actions.
3. **Animation Effects**: Add subtle animations for reactions to improve visual feedback.
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Expand filtering to include date ranges and content keywords.

## Conclusion

All six features have been successfully implemented, tested, and documented. The enhancements significantly improve Commento's functionality while maintaining its performance and minimalist approach. The project is complete and ready for production deployment.
