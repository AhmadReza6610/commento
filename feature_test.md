# Commento Enhanced Features Test Results

## Test Summary

We've successfully tested all the new features implemented in the Commento platform. Below are the results of each feature test and documentation on how to use them.

## 1. Mark Comment as Spoiler

**Test Status: âœ… Working**

The spoiler feature allows comment authors and moderators to mark a comment as containing spoilers, causing the comment text to be blurred until the user hovers over it.

### How it works:
- Comment owners and moderators see a "Mark as spoiler" button in the comment options
- When clicked, the comment text gets the "spoiler" class applied
- The text appears blurred until a user hovers over it
- Clicking the button again removes the spoiler status

### Technical implementation:
- Backend: New `spoiler` boolean column in the comments table
- API: New `/api/comment/spoiler` endpoint in `comment_reaction.go`
- Frontend: `commento-spoiler.js` for toggling spoiler status
- CSS: Blur effect via `filter: blur(5px)` in `commento-features.scss`

## 2. Downvote Counter

**Test Status: âœ… Working**

A separate counter to display the number of downvotes a comment has received, complementing the existing score display.

### How it works:
- Each comment now shows both the overall score and the number of downvotes
- Downvote count is displayed with a downward arrow (â†“) and the count number
- The count is colored red to distinguish it from the main score

### Technical implementation:
- Backend: DB function to count negative votes separately
- API: Modified `commentList` to include downvote counts
- Frontend: Added downvote counter element in the comment rendering function
- CSS: Styled with `color: #ff4136` in `commento-features.scss`

## 3. Timestamp Hyperlinks

**Test Status: âœ… Working**

Automatically converts timestamps in comments to clickable links that trigger custom events for integration with media players.

### How it works:
- Timestamps like "1:30" or "5:45" are automatically detected in comment text
- They're converted to clickable links with the class "timestamp-link"
- When clicked, they trigger a custom "commentoTimestamp" event
- External scripts can listen for this event to control media players

### Technical implementation:
- Frontend: `commento-timestamps.js` handles detection and event dispatching
- Uses regex pattern matching to identify timestamp formats
- No backend changes required as this is purely frontend functionality
- CSS: Timestamps are styled with blue underlined text

### Usage example:
```javascript
document.addEventListener('commentoTimestamp', function(e) {
  // e.detail.timestamp contains the timestamp string (e.g., "1:30")
  // Code to navigate video player to this timestamp
  console.log('Timestamp clicked:', e.detail.timestamp);
});
```

## 4. Reaction System

**Test Status: âœ… Working**

Allows users to react to comments with emoji reactions instead of just upvotes/downvotes.

### How it works:
- Four reaction types available: Funny (ðŸ˜„), Interesting (ðŸ¤”), Upsetting (ðŸ˜ ), and Sad (ðŸ˜¢)
- Users can toggle reactions on and off by clicking
- Multiple reaction types can be added to the same comment
- Active reactions are highlighted with a blue background

### Technical implementation:
- Backend: New `reactions` table to store user reactions by type
- API: New `/api/comment/reaction` endpoint in `comment_reaction.go`
- Frontend: `commento-reactions.js` handles adding/removing reactions
- CSS: Styled as rounded buttons with emoji + count

## 5. Sort by Reaction Score

**Test Status: âœ… Working**

Enhances the comment sorting system to allow sorting by different reaction types.

### How it works:
- New sorting options added to the sort dropdown:
  - Funniest
  - Most Interesting
  - Most Upsetting
  - Saddest
- Comments with the most reactions of the selected type appear at the top

### Technical implementation:
- Added new sort policy constants in `commento.js`:
  ```javascript
  var SORT_POLICY_REACTION_FUNNY_DESC = "reaction-funny-desc";
  var SORT_POLICY_REACTION_INTERESTING_DESC = "reaction-interesting-desc";
  var SORT_POLICY_REACTION_UPSETTING_DESC = "reaction-upsetting-desc";
  var SORT_POLICY_REACTION_SAD_DESC = "reaction-sad-desc";
  ```
- Updated the `parentMap` function to handle reaction-based sorting
- Added UI labels for the new sorting options
- No backend changes required as sorting happens on the client side

## 6. Filter by Username

**Test Status: âœ… Working**

Allows users to filter comments to only show those from a specific commenter.

### How it works:
- A "Filter by username" input field appears above the comments
- As the user types, comments are dynamically filtered
- Only comments from users whose username contains the typed text are shown
- Clearing the field shows all comments again

### Technical implementation:
- Frontend: `commento-filter.js` implements filtering logic
- Uses the existing commenters object to match usernames
- CSS: Filter input styled consistently with Commento's design
- No backend changes required as filtering happens on the client side

## Overall Integration

The features have been successfully integrated into the Commento platform without disrupting the existing functionality. The application maintains its clean, minimal interface while providing these powerful new capabilities.

All features are optional and unobtrusive, maintaining Commento's focus on being a lightweight commenting system.
